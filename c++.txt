BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT IN C++
c++ comes with libraries which helps us in performing input/output. in c++, sequence of bytes corrosponding to 
input and output are commonly known as streams.
INPUT STREAM: Direction of flow of bytes takes from input device for example from input device (keyboard) to the main memory
OUTPUT STREAM: Direction of flow of bytes takes from main memory to the output device such as display.

Earthametic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, Scope resolution operator (::) 

a++: first print the value of a and increment
++a: first increment and then print
