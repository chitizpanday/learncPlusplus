c++ is a semi object oriented, case sensitive, platform dependent, before the name c++, it was called c with class.

c++ is a semi object oriented programming, platform dependent, 

c++ program -----> compiler----------> .exe file
	(compilation/build)

imporatnat data types:
1 Built in data types: int (-1,0,2,4,112..) Float (1.12, 1.3....) Double (1.234545 double is a float with more presicion)
Char ('a' 'n' 'k' ...) boolean (true/false)
2. user defined data types: struct, union, enum
3. derived data types: Array, functions, pointers

int sum = 10 means: sum is an integer variable/integer container that holds the value of in in memory.
 
BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT IN C++
c++ comes with libraries which helps us in performing input/output. in c++, sequence of bytes corrosponding to 
input and output are commonly known as streams.
INPUT STREAM: Direction of flow of bytes takes from input device for example from input device (keyboard) to the main memory
OUTPUT STREAM: Direction of flow of bytes takes from main memory to the output device such as display.

Earthametic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, Scope resolution operator (::) 

a++: first print the value of a and increment
++a: first increment and then print

Variable: variable is the name of the momory location where we store value.
const keyword is used to declare a constant, constant can be of any datatype, 
constants are also called literals, we can change the value of constant forcefully using pointer.

derived data types: Array, string, function, pointer
Array: 1 D array and 2 D array.

Function is a block of code that runs only when it is called. there are two types of functions: user defined and predefined.
